# Face Recognition and Data Logging System (Python)

Welcome to the Face Recognition and Data Logging System repository. This Python program is designed to perform facial recognition on images, capture relevant person data, and log the recognition time into an Excel file. The system is a powerful tool for accurately identifying individuals and maintaining a record of their interactions.

## Features and Functionality

1. **Face Recognition:** Utilizes advanced image processing techniques to perform accurate facial recognition on input images.

2. **Person Data Collection:** Captures and stores essential person data, including name, ID, and other relevant information.

3. **Excel Data Logging:** Logs the recognized person's data along with the recognition timestamp into an Excel spreadsheet.

4. **Efficient Record Keeping:** Provides an organized and efficient way to track and manage interactions based on facial recognition.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone (https://github.com/OmarAbusnad/Face_Detection).git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries (such as `opencv-python` and `openpyxl`).

3. **Run the System:** Execute the main Python script (e.g., `python face_recognition_system.py`) to launch the Face Recognition and Data Logging System.

## Usage

1. **Input Image:** Provide an input image containing the face of the person you wish to recognize.

2. **Face Recognition:** The system processes the image to identify the person and captures relevant data.

3. **Data Logging:** The recognized person's data, including name and recognition time, is logged into an Excel file.

## Conclusion

The Face Recognition and Data Logging System is a powerful tool that combines facial recognition technology with efficient data logging capabilities. By accurately identifying individuals and maintaining a record of their interactions, this system offers enhanced security and effective management of person-related data.
